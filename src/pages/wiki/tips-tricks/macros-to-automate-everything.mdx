# Macros to automate everything

Instead of automating many different parameters, map parameters to a macro first, then automate the macro instead.
Set the macro to fully open, activate mapping and go play around with parameters to find a cool sound. Now you can morph between the base preset and this new variation with a single knob.
This will keep things much cleaner, it also means you can tweak the variation at a later time without the need to adjust all the automations.
