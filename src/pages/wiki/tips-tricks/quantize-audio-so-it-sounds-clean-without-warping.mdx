# Quantize audio so it sounds clean without warping 

  1. Select an audio clip you want to quantize
  2. Make sure the onsets align with the transients you want to be quantized
  3. use **Split at onsets** on the whole clip. 3. Select all clips and quantize them.
  4. select everything and reverse it. 5. use "make legato" on everything.
  6. "Reverse" everything again so it's no longer reversed.
  7. use "auto-fade"
  8. hold shift while dragging the cross fades slightly behind so that it sounds smooth.
  9. profit!
